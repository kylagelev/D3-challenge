# D3-challenge

## Utilizes Javascript (D3 library) to visualize 2010 Census data.

Census data includes information about the state, poverty rates, healthcare rate, obesity rates, median age, median income, and smoking rates.

Created a series of functions to scale plot based on selected Y or X axis selection. Added circles based on X and Y axis and selected label. Also, includes a Tooltip which displays that state's name and the selected xlabel and ylabel of the specific state that was selected (aka moused over). 

Completed website features interactive graph where user can choose what axes they would like to see.

Also, includes a few of my own insights based on the graph on the actual webpage itself.
Feel free to play around and get develop your own insights!

Launched using Github Pages.

(Includes testing.js which is a baseline plot using D3 that was used to refer back to.)
